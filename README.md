# Internship Challenge - Single Page Website

**Project Overview:**
This project was developed as part of an internship challenge, requiring the conversion of a Figma design into a fully responsive, real-world web page. While it is not pixel-perfect, the final result demonstrates my ability to translate Figma mockups into functional websites. I also learned new techniques while working on this project.

**Key Features:**

- Fully responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes.
- Clean and structured code implementation.
- Accurate representation of the provided Figma design.
- Optimized layout with improved styling for a better user experience.
- Fast loading and smooth performance.

**Technologies Used:**

- React
- TailwindCSS
- GSAP
- CSS

**Challenges Faced:**

- Ensuring design accuracy while maintaining responsiveness.
- Managing layout adjustments and CSS styling to match the Figma specifications.
- Handling minor inconsistencies due to time constraints.
- Adding lightning effects
- animated features Cards
**Outcome:**
This project showcases my ability to convert Figma designs into fully functional websites. While it is not 100% complete, it effectively demonstrates my front-end development skills and attention to detail. Given more time, I could refine it further, but it already stands as a  portfolio piece, proving my capability to handle real-world design-to-code conversions.
